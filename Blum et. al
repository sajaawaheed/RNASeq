Mouse Neuron

Introduction

Blum et al. (2021) performed single nucleus RNA sequencing analysis on motor neurons from the adult mouse spinal cord. They identified 16 sympathetic motor neuron clusters and were surprised to discover skeletal motor neuron heterogeneity within the spinal cord. This is an extraordinarily complex analysis that interests me particularly because of my work in intraoperative neurodiagnostics.

To strengthen my bioinformatics skills, experience, and neurological knowledge, I wanted to explore this data with the objective of correctly identifying neuronal cell types based on gene expression. I aim to reconstruct figures, taking note in the nuances that may warrant further scientific investigation.
