# RNASeq

ðŸ”­ I am a recent M.S. Bioinformatics graduate with a with experience analyzing data in Python and R. I am searching for a professional Bioinformatics Analyst role and would like to use Github to showcase my experience through self driven projects where I reanalyze/recreate data and figures from published papers. I have special interest in diseases of the brain and spinal cord. -->

Analysis #1: Mouse Neuron
Blum et al. (2021) performed single nucleus RNA sequencing analysis on the adult mouse spinal cord and identified 16 sympathetic motor neuron clusters. They were surprised to discover skeletal motor neuron heterogeneity within the spinal cord. This is an extraordinarily complex analysis that interests me particularly because of my work in intraoperative neurodiagnostics.

To strengthen my bioinformatics skills, experience, and neurological knowledge, I wanted to explore this data with the objective of correctly identifying neuronal cell types based on gene expression. I aim to reconstruct figures, taking note in the nuances that may warrant further scientific investigation. 

Goal #1: Reconstruct Figure 1 & 4a with a focus on analyzing transciptome of alpha motor neurons. 

Why this figure/group of neurons? When I began the project of reanalyzing the dataset I'm realizing that I need to hone in on a specific task within the research that was conducted. Alpha motor neurons were group #1 from the folder that was split (due to memory capabilities.) I'll see where this takes me.
